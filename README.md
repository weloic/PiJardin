# PiJardin
Micro domotic project for water management, using a raspberry pi and arduino for sensors.


## Pi Initialisation
Run once on a fresh Pi to register all systemd units and start the automation:

```bash
bash ~/PiJardin/deploy/bootstrap.sh
```

After that, `deploy.timer` pulls and redeploys the repo automatically every 15 minutes, and `sensors.timer` reads sensor data every 5 minutes on the clock.

## Manual testing
You can force data collection with:
```
systemctl start sensors.service
```

And visualize output using:
```
journalctl -u sensors.service -n 30
```

## Telegram bot deploy
Once .env is set, run following to deploy:
```
sudo systemctl restart telegram-bot.service
```

Users register themselves by messaging the bot `/start <password>`. The password determines their role:
- `TELEGRAM_PASSWORD_ADMIN` in `.env` — registers as `admin`
- `TELEGRAM_PASSWORD_VIEWER` in `.env` — registers as `viewer`

Registered chat IDs and roles are stored in `sensors/.telegram_users.json` (gitignored, not committed).

Alert delivery is independent of role and off by default. Once registered, a user toggles it with `/alerts on` or `/alerts off` (or `/alerts` with no argument to check the current setting).
